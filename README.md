## Algorithm Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Initialize variables to track planes needed and the farthest reachable airport.
2. **Iterate through airports**: Iterate through airports, updating reachable distance and planes needed.
3. **Check reachability**: Check if the last airport is reachable. If so, return the count of planes needed.
4. **Exit condition**: If not reachable, return -1.
